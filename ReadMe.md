# cub3D

_This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by nfakih and miwehbe._

# Description

A 3D graphical representation of a maze from a first-person perspective, inspired by Wolfenstein.

- **Raycasting Engine**: Full DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) algorithm implementation
- **Textured Walls**: Different textures for each cardinal direction (North, South, East, West)
- **Player Movement**: Smooth WASD movement with arrow key rotation
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents walking through walls
- **Custom Maps**: Parse and validate `.cub` map files
- **RGB Colors**: Customizable floor and ceiling colors
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and clean error messages

# Instructions

After cloning the repository, enter the folder, make and run the executable "cub3d" using one of the maps.

```bash
make

./cub3D map.cub
```

# Controls

W - Move forward
S - Move backward
A - Move left
D - Move right
← - Rotate left
→ - Rotate right
ESC / x button - Exit program


# Goals
- Read a 2D map from a .cub file (parsing and validation)
- Placing the player inside it and handle player view
- Using raycasting to display a 3D maze
- Allowing the player to:
- Move
- Rotate
- See the correct textured walls
- Correctly collide with walls

## Parsing

The parsing module handles reading, validating, and preparing the
.cub map file for the game engine. This ensures maps are safe and playable.

1. *** Some_Map_Rules_For_Parsing**

Valid Maps:
- Must be surrounded by walls (closed)
- Contains exactly one player position (N/S/E/W)
- Only uses valid characters: `0`, `1`, `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, space
- 0 for empty space, 1 for walls, N/S/E/W for player
- Lines can have different lengths (spaces handled correctly)
- Colors in rgb values
- The map needs to be the last item in the file

2. *** Map_File_Format**

NO ./textures/north.xpm

3. ***Notes**

- Spaces inside the map are allowed only if they are unreachable from the player

- Leading and trailing spaces are automatically handled by normalization

- Exactly one player start position is required for a valid map

- Error handling provides descriptive messages if the map is invalid

## Raycasting

Raycasting is a way to create a 3D game/view from a 2D map

1. **Casting rays** from the player's position for each screen column
2. **Traversing the grid** using DDA until hitting a wall
3. **Calculating distance** to determine wall height
4. **Drawing vertical slices** with appropriate textures
5. **Rendering floor and ceiling** with solid colors

# Most Important Formulas

```c
// Ray direction for each screen column
ray_dir_x = player_dir_x + camera_plane_x * camera_x
ray_dir_y = player_dir_y + camera_plane_y * camera_x

// Distance to next grid line
delta_dist_x = fabs(1 / ray_dir_x)
delta_dist_y = fabs(1 / ray_dir_y)

// Perpendicular wall distance (prevents fish-eye effect)
perp_wall_dist = (map_x - player_x + (1 - step_x) / 2) / ray_dir_x

// Wall height calculation
line_height = (int)(screen_height / perp_wall_dist)
```
